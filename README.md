# My Reading List

My Reading List is a powerful and intuitive Chrome extension designed to help you manage and organize articles you wish to read later. Whether you're researching for a project, exploring interesting topics, or simply bookmarking articles for future reference, this extension ensures you never lose track of the valuable content you come across on the web.

## Core Features

1. Effortless Bookmarking

    Quickly bookmark any article with a single click. The extension adds a convenient "Bookmark this article" button to every webpage you visit, allowing you to save articles instantly.

2. Automatic Title Fetching

    When you bookmark an article, the extension automatically fetches and displays the article's title, making it easier for you to recognize and organize your saved content.

3. Persistent Storage

    All your bookmarked articles are stored locally on your device, ensuring that your reading list is always accessible, even when you're offline.

4. Easy Access to Bookmarked Articles

    Access your reading list by clicking on the extension icon. The popup displays a neatly organized list of your saved articles, complete with their titles and links.

5. Article Management

    Easily manage your reading list with the ability to remove articles you no longer need. Each article in the list has a "Remove" button for quick deletion.

6. Visual Indicators

    The extension includes visual indicators to show which articles have already been bookmarked. Once an article is bookmarked, the "Bookmark this article" button changes to indicate the article is saved, preventing duplicate bookmarks.

7. Hover to View Full Titles

    For articles with long titles, the extension uses text truncation with ellipsis in the list view. Hover over the truncated title to see the full article title as a tooltip.

8. User-Friendly Interface

    The extension features a clean, minimalist design that is easy to navigate. The interface is intuitive, with a focus on user experience and functionality.

9. No Bookmarked Articles Notification

    When there are no articles in your reading list, the extension displays a friendly message indicating that there are no bookmarked articles yet, encouraging you to start saving content.
